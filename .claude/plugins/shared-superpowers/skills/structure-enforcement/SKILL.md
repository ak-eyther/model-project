# Structure Enforcement

## Validation

```bash
# Check structure
python .claude/scripts/structure_validator.py

# Auto-fix violations (dry-run first)
python .claude/scripts/auto_fix.py --dry-run
python .claude/scripts/auto_fix.py --apply
```

## Rules (canonical-structure.yaml)

```yaml
file_types:
  - name: "completion_reports"
    patterns:
      - "*-COMPLETE*.md"
    canonical_location: ".claude/archive/completion-reports/"
```

## Pre-Commit Hook

Files automatically validated before commit. Violations block commit.

## Common Violations

```
❌ Completion reports in root
✅ Move to .claude/archive/completion-reports/

❌ Memory files in wrong location
✅ Move to .claude/memory/
```
