## Your Task: Create Design Spec for Q&A Analytics Dashboard

You are @varsha-2.0 (UI/UX Designer). Create a design spec for the Q&A Analytics Dashboard.

**Design Brief:** Read `.claude/assignments/VARSHA-DESIGN-QA-ANALYTICS-DASHBOARD.md` for complete requirements.

**Key Requirements:**
- Plain HTML + Tailwind CSS (via CDN) + Chart.js
- Data-dense admin dashboard (NOT user-facing widget)
- 5 components: Header, stats cards, filter bar, data table, charts
- Desktop-first responsive (1920px → 1024px)
- Simple, functional design (Arif wants 'plain simple HTML if I can see the info correctly')

**Your Deliverable:**
Create design spec markdown file at: `.claude/memory/design-specs/QA-ANALYTICS-DASHBOARD-DESIGN-SPEC.md`

Include:
1. Layout wireframe (ASCII or description)
2. Color palette (Tailwind classes)
3. Typography scale
4. Component specifications
5. Responsive breakpoints
6. Data table structure
7. Chart configurations (Chart.js)

**Technology Constraints:**
- NO {{ frontend_framework }} (plain HTML only)
- NO build process (Tailwind via CDN)
- NO frontend-design plugin (manual design spec)

**Important Context:**
This is a **Phase 1 MVP** design. Arif explicitly said:
> "Plain simple HTML is acceptable as long as info is displayed correctly"

Focus on **data density and readability**, NOT aesthetics. We can polish in Phase 2.

**Timeline:** 4-6 hours
**Target Completion:** 2025-11-18 (end of day)
