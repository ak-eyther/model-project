vim .claude/agents/anand-2.0.md

# Add to skills section:
skills:
  # ... existing ...
  - code-review
  - security-scanning
  - backend-development
  - api-development
  - database
  - database-migrations
```

**Validate:**
```bash
.claude/scripts/validate-plugins.sh
```

**Expected Impact:**
- 40+ new skills available across agents
- Core capabilities significantly enhanced

---

### Phase 2: P1 Plugins (Soon - 1 hour)

**Add high-value plugins for each agent**

**Validate:**
```bash
.claude/scripts/validate-plugins.sh
```

**Expected Impact:**
- 70+ total skills available
- Comprehensive tool coverage

---

### Phase 3: P2 Plugins (As Needed - Ongoing)

**Add situational plugins based on project needs**

---

## 📋 Quick Start Commands

### Update @anand-2.0 (Example)

```bash
# Backup current config
cp .claude/agents/anand-2.0.md .claude/agents/anand-2.0.md.backup

# Edit and add P0 plugins (see recommendations above)
# Then validate
.claude/scripts/validate-plugins.sh
```

### Batch Update All Agents

Want me to create a script to auto-update all agents with P0 plugins? I can generate the updated YAML for each agent!

**Next Step:** Would you like me to:
1. ✅ **Auto-update all agents with P0 plugins** (recommended)
2. 📝 Show example updated config for one agent first
3. 🔧 Create a script to batch-update all agents
